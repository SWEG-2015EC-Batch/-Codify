problem Analysis

Input: read num1 and num2  and anoperator

Process:
 - Variable declaration
 
 - accept the first and second number as input

 - ask the to input operator

 -   the user to enter the second number and Accept the user input.

 - Compute the respective operation the the specific operator used

 - ask the user to input 0 to else go to 1 and repeat

Output: The result of the respective processStep 1: start
 
  Step 2: read the first number(x)
  
  Step 3: read the operator
  
  Step 4: read the second number(y)
  
  Step 5: if operator == + print x + y
    
     else if operator == '-' print x - y
     
     else if operator == '-' print x - y
     
     else if operator == '*' / 'x' / 'X' print x * y
     
     else if operator == '/' print x / y   Step 6: prompt the user to enter 0 to exit.
 
  Step 7: read exit_code
  
  Step 8: if exit_code == 0 go to step 9
    
    else go to step 2
  
  Step 9: stop
