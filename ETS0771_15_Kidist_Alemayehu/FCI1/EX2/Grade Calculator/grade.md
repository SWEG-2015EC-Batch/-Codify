problem analysis for grade calculator
input: take input quize out of 5%,test 10%, project 20%, final 50%
output: letter grade
process: - compute total by suming up the inputs
          -  use selection statement to calculate grade letter
          - display the respective letter for the total

pseudocode for grade calculator
step 1, variable declaration
step2, taking input, quize, test, assignmet,final_exam, project
step3, compute total
step 4,  if total>= 90 display it is A+
        else iftotal>= 80 && total <= 90 display  it's A
         else if total>= 75 && total <= 80 display it's B+
         else if total>= 60 && total <= 75 it's B
         else if total>= 55 && total <= 60 display it's C+
        else iftotal>= 45 & total <= 55 display it's C
         else if total>= 30 & total <= 45 display it's D
        else if total < 30 it's F
step 5, end
