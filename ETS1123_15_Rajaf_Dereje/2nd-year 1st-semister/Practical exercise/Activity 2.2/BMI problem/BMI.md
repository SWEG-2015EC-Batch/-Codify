Analysis 
input: height and weight
output: body mass index
process: weight divided by height squared 

Algorithm in psudocode:
step 1: start
step 2: input height, width 
step 3: calculate height square = height*height 
step 4: calculate BMI = weight divided by height squared
step 5: print BMI
step 6: end

Algorithm in flowchart:

A([start]) --> B[/enter your weight in kilogram/];
B --> C[/enter your height in meters/];
C --> D["BMI = body_weight / (height*height)"];
D --> E[/print 'your BMI is' BMI/];
E --> F([end]);
```
