Analysis 
input : file size in bytes 
output : time it takes to transfer the file
process : second = data/960, minuit = second /60, hour = minuit/60

algorithm in psudocode:
step 1: start 
step 2: input file size in bytes 
step 3: second = data/960
step 4: minuit = second /60
step 5: hour = minuit/60
step 6: print second, minuit, hour
step 7: end
