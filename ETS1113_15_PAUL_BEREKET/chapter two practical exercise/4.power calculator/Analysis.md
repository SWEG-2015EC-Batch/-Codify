      Problem description   
 

Write a program that find the result of the expression of x ^ Y where the value of X and Y 
are entered by the user.  
   

      Problem analysis 

Input: base (X) and exponent (Y) numbers   

Output: the result of x the power of y.    
     

Process:  

 Variable declaration- x, y 

No Initialization  

Ask the user to input the base and exponent numbers. 

Read the numbers. 

Calculate x the power of y. 

Display the result. 

        Design 

Variable declaration:  

Int x, y, z ; 

Reading input data:  

cout << "Enter the base number:" ; 

cin >> x ; 

cout<< "Enter the number on the exponent:" ; 

cin>> y; 

 

Perform the opertation: 

Z = pow(x,y);          

   Pseudo code  

Step 1.  start 

Step 2.  Prompt the user to input the value of X 

Step 3. Read and store the value of X 

  

Step 4. Prompt the user to input the value of Y 

Step 5. Read and store the value of Y 

  

Step 6. Calculate the result of X raised to the power of Y 

Step 7. Display the result to the user 

Step 8. End
