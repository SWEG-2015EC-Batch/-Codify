                  Problem description  

1.  . Make a program that calculates and display the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a 
person. The program should read the height and weight of a person being given 
and display the BMI.  


                 Problem analysis 

Input: A persons height and weight. 

Output: The body mass Index (BMI) of the person and an indication that if a person is underweight, overweight, or at normal weight 

Process:  
        Variable declaration- involves declaring height, weight, and BMI. 
        No initialization.
        Ask the user to input the height and weight of the person. 
        Take those data as an input. 
        Calculate the BMI from the height and weight of the person. 

                           Design 

Variable declaration:  
       float height, weight, BMI ; 

Reading input data:  
       cout<< “ Enter the height of the person” << endl: 
      cin>> height 
      cout  <<” Enter the weight of the person” << endl; 
      cin>> weight; 

                  Perform the operation: 

BMI=weight / pow(height,2) ; 

                  Print the result: 

cout<<” The body mass index of the person is” << BMI ; 

                   Pseudo code  

step 1. Start 

step 2. Read height  

step 3. Read weight 

step 4. Calculate BMI, BMI= weight  / height^2 

step 5. Print the BMI 

step 6. End
